# LinearActuatorArduinoControl

## Description
This Repo conatins all necessary information to control a Firgelli Linear Actuator with a custom Human Machine Interface (HMI) using an Arduino UNO R3 controller.

The provided Arduino R3 UNO c++ code is specificially to control this hardware in the context of a custom reciprocating robot. The purpose of this robot is to:
1. Open a parallel plate MEA test fixture to allow loading of an MEA
1. Close test fixture and apply a defined pressure to the MEA
1. Maintain a defined pressure on the MEA during operation/experimentation

This is accomplished by coupling a linear actuator to one half of a commercial MEA test fixture (eg. LeanCat Aircell) such that it can freely reciprocate to engage and disengage the mating half, and rigidly affixing the mating half to a laboratory bench to maintain spatial relation to all other components. This enables the linear actuator to open and close the MEA Test Fixture.

The coupling between the linear actuator and the reciprocating test fixture half integrates a miniature load cell to measure the force applied by the actuator to the text fixture. The load cell signal is amplified, and transmitted to the Arduino, via an active strain meter. This force, and the geometric area of the MEA, define the mechanical pressure applied to the MEA during operation.

Once the MEA Test Fixture is Closed, the Force is visually monitored and manually adjusted via _Pot_ to a desired value, and then the mode _switch_ is set to `Maintain Pressure`. When the _Switch_ is flipped to `Maintain Pressure`, it records the current applied force, and then maintains the linear actuator position such that the applied force is constant during the execution of the experimental campaign.  

## Operation
To operate in manual mode, all triggers and setpoints for Actuator operation are controlled and manually set by the user. This is accomplished via the HMI, which comprises __One Switch__, and __One Potentiometer__. 
- The _Switch_ controls the operating mode of the system: Either `Manual Positioning`, or `Maintain Pressure`
- The _Potentiometer_ controls the speed and direction of the linear actuator motion when in `Manual Positioning` mode. The more the Pot is turned, the faster the actuator extends/retracts. There is a 'dead zone' in the Pot midrange in which there is no motion. The _Potentiometer_ is NOT used in `Maintain Pressure` mode.
- An Emergency Stop signal which overrides the above settings and stops all motion. Neither the _Switch_ nor the _Pot_ are active in this mode. This signal is intended to be a physical switch.

To operate in auto mode, all triggers and setpoints for Actuator operation are controlled and computationally set programatically via software, eg. HELAO. There is NO HMI, however there should still be a physical E-Stop button which stops all motion when an error is detected by the user. 

### SOP

When in manual mode, the linear actuator is controlled by the user via an HMI (_Potentiometer_ and _Switch_). 

Initialization:
- MEA Test Fixture `OPEN`
- HMI _Switch_ in `Manual Positioning` mode
- HMI _Pot_ in `Dead Zone`, ie No Actuator Motion
- _Emergency Stop_ OFF, ie instrument active
